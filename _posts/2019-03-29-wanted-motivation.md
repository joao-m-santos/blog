Throughout my life I&#39;ve met many people who were interested in learning how to code, but were somewhat lost and didn&#39;t know where to begin, and that made them lose motivation and forfeit their goal of picking up their first programming language.

## Introduction

We&#39;ve all been there. When beginning a learning process, our goal seems immensely distant. And that often makes you quit before even starting.

When I was studying Computer Engineering in college, I was mainly being taught software development languages. At that time, I didn&#39;t know anything about web development, but I was becoming curious about it.

That&#39;s when I encountered the problem of lack of motivation. To me, web development was a completely different world and even though I had an idea of where to start, it seemed like there was so much I didn&#39;t know that I wouldn&#39;t possibly be able to learn it from zero. Time went on and I never had the drive to start, until much later in my life.

## Why does this happen?

I can think of a number of reasons why one tends to leave something behind instead of taking in a totally new challenge. One of them and possibly the main reason is, as I&#39;ve explained before, feeling overwhelmed by a notion of too many new concepts and contents. There are also other causes such as:

-   Not knowing where to start
-   Lack of free time
-   Disliking conventional learning methods
-   Not having access to classes

These are all valid reasons, but you shouldn&#39;t give up on learning only because one of them is in play. Let&#39;s see what you can do to fight back this lack of motivation.

## Personal projects

This is, in my opinion, the best way to get into a new programming language or any set of skills.

There&#39;s nothing like well-defined personal goal of yours that is only achievable by searching and learning new contents, because believing in what you&#39;re working on is the first step to be motivated to complete it. Another great advantage is that since you&#39;re working for yourself, there&#39;s no hard deadline to comply, so you can find moments in your busy life and take your time to consolidate your recently acquired knowledge.

That&#39;s how I got into web development - soon after leaving college, a friend of mine proposed building a complex website idea from scratch, when neither of us had any knowledge of front-end or back-end development. Having a concise set of objectives, it was surprisingly easy to pick up the basic concepts of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP, and from there, I realized this was what I enjoyed the most and what I wanted to keep learning for the rest of my professional life.

_If you're wondering about that project, it ended up never seeing the light of day. But I regard it as one of my most important stepping stones._

## Learning tools

If you feel lost right in the start of your path, you should remember that everyone has felt like that before. That is why there are many different learning tools available online that defy the classic learning methods.

Nowadays, anyone can take free courses on any programming language online. And if that wasn&#39;t enough, there are some platforms that offer even more interactive learning experiences.

If you think you&#39;d prefer the more traditional online course approach, you can search around the following platforms for courses you find interesting:

-   [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/)
-   [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/)
-   [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/)

If you&#39;d like to explore more interactive or different ways of learning new things, you may want to check these platforms out:

-   [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com/) - fully-interactive courses
-   [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com) - learning programming logic by playing a game

## What&#39;s next?

After finding your motivation, the sky&#39;s the limit. But, although I encourage following a learning path by yourself, it&#39;s always great to discuss your findings with others, maybe they are in the same level as you or are more experienced. One thing that has helped me a lot is learning something together with a friend or a colleague with whom you can debate your discoveries and help each other understand all concepts of a subject.

Aside from that, it&#39;s also good to share your projects with the world, so you can get feedback and advice, while inspiring others that might be lacking motivation like you once were.

What do you think? Are you interested in a new coding language or framework, but feeling uninspired about taking the first step to learn it? Or have you been through this apprehension, but found other ways of fighting it back? If so, I&#39;d love to hear them!
